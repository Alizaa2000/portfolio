                My academic journey began with a BSc in Chemistry, a testament to my curiosity and analytical mindset. As I transitioned into the world of business, I discovered my true calling in HR. I believe that my scientific background equips me with a unique perspective, enabling me to approach HR challenges with a methodical and strategic approach.

I am passionate about fostering a positive work environment and leveraging my interpersonal skills to create synergy among teams.
